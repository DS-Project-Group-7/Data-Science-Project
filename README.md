## Project Problem Description
- Clean and transform the raw dataset, which contains the conservation record of 208 early to mid 20th century canvas paintings from Southeast Asia, into an interactive dashboard for visualisation.
- Identify the relationship between different painting conditions, test whether they are independent or related.
- Build machine learning models to predict missing values for various conditions that are hard to identify via visual inspection.

## Cleaning process

If one wants to run the cleaning script they must run the python command 
```
python dataCleaning.py
```
while having `data_cleaning` as the working directory (commands like `ls` and `cd` help choosing the working directory)
